Some years, our first seed hasn’t even made it out of groups (TSM 0–6 Worlds any% never forget). I try not to cheer for NA teams because I can’t handle the heartbreak. I didn’t watch game 5 of FLY vs GenG last year because I was afraid to watch them lose (They lost ┬┬﹏┬┬). So this year, I told myself I wasn’t gonna get my hopes up.\n\n  But 100Thieves have changed my mind. \n\nFrom 6th to runner-up to LTA 3rd seed, it’s impossible not to get excited for the Thieves. Especially after last night, with 100T Dhokla, Big Dhokes, Mr. D. H. Kola, our North American knight in Sion armour, steamrolling through fights and solo-killing BLG Knight under BLG’s inhibitor turret. (Of course, the rest of the team did well too, but Sion is my third favourite champion. I’m allowed to have my bias.)\n\n The team might be disbanding after this season, but the players living up to the Worlds theme. I have a feeling the Thieves are going to steal a spot in semis and Earn Their Legacy.\n\n Or I’m speaking too soon and they’re not making it out of Swiss. \n\nWho knows? We’ll find out at 4:00 AM EST, when 100T roll TES (✿◠‿◠)",
